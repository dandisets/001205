description: 'Associated Reference Publication: Sensory systems adapt their response
  properties to the statistics of their inputs. For instance, visual systems adapt
  to low-order statistics like mean and variance to encode stimuli efficiently or
  to facilitate specific downstream computations. However, it remains unclear how
  other statistical features affect sensory adaptation. Here, we explore how Drosophila’s
  visual motion circuits adapt to stimulus sparsity, a measure of the signal’s intermittency
  not captured by low-order statistics alone. Early visual neurons in both ON and
  OFF pathways alter their responses dramatically with stimulus sparsity, responding
  positively to both light and dark sparse stimuli but linearly to dense stimuli.
  These changes extend to downstream ON and OFF direction-selective neurons, which
  are activated by sparse stimuli of both polarities, but respond with opposite signs
  to light and dark regions of dense stimuli. Thus, sparse stimuli activate both ON
  and OFF pathways, recruiting a larger fraction of the circuit and potentially enhancing
  the salience of isolated stimuli. Overall, our results reveal visual response properties
  that increase the fraction of the circuit responding to sparse, isolated stimuli.'
